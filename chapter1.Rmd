```{r code1, echo=F}

```

# This is the Introduction to Open Data Science course diary for week `r week_no ` 

*In this course, I will learn to use all kinds of cool tools, including R, R markdown and Git(Hub)*

[//]: The week we are now on is week number `r week_no`. By the way, the week number was not written directly by me: instead, at the beginning of the document I defined the variable week_no like this: ` week_no <- 1 `. Later, in the text I just wrote `week_no ` in the text, surrounded by ` `` `` `
